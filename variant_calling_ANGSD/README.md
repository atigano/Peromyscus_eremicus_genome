## Processing of raw data and mapping to reference genome
1. ```fastp.sh``` to trim adapters and poly G tails (data sequenced with Novaseq platform).
2. ```split.sh``` to split fastq files and expedite mapping.
3. ```bwa_wgr_peer.sh``` to map trimmed whole genome resequencing data to Cactus mouse reference genome and remove duplicates
4. ```mergebams.sh``` to merge bams
5. ```sort_index``` to sort and index bams

## Variant calling in ANGSD
Note that these analyses include 25 *Peromyscus eremicus* individuals, after removal of an outlier individual based on PCA and MDS 
I run ANGSD iteratively. First I call variants with stringent quality filters across individuals from two populations (global calling) with ```angsd_peer_global_noout.sh``` 
High-quality variants are recalled, and allele frequencies estimated, for each of the two populations with ```angsd_peer_pop.sh```

I calculate the thetas with ```angsd_theta_peer_global_noout.sh``` to get estimates of π and Tajima's D across all individuals.
